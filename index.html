        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>How can the Boroondara City Council improve communication about the progress towards net zero emissions and the impacts of climate change?</p>
        <p>In an age where information and misinformation is getting harder to distinguish, clear and effective communication on climate change impacts and policies is more important than ever to achieve community engagement.</p>
        <p>The scale and uncertainty of climate change is intangible to every-day citizens, with no comparison to the experience of real-world effects. Studies show that a significant proportion of people struggle to form concrete associations with climate change impacts due to the magnitudes of the effects and the mental capacity needed to address such a devastating issue (Leviston et al. 2014, p. 441).</p>
        <p>In order to engage meaningfully with the community on the topics of climate change impacts and net zero emissions targets, data-driven communication strategies have been identified to drive the design of a community engagement program.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="Research">
        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h2>Community Engagement</h2>
        <p>It is important for a local governing body to take meaningful actions towards net zero targets from a point of view of “boosting the community as a whole”. In the context of climate change, people are more likely to support climate policies if they believe the messenger cares about the impact of the policies on the lives of the community, and are also engaging meaningfully with the policies themselves (Maibach et al. 2023, p. 61).</p>
        <h2>Improving Climate Messaging</h2>
        <p>Climate policy and targets communicated with language that does not deny the existence of climate change improves engagement. The use of vague language to take a more “apolitical stance” at the existence and effects of climate change disengages the audience from the core message. Similarly, using “alarmist” language is shown to distress audiences, instead achieving counter-productive results (Nerlich et al. 2010, p.103).</p>
        <p>Up to 98% of environmental news stories are negative in nature (De Meyer et al. 2020, p. 1), with the majority of communities understanding the link to impacts of climate change. The messaging to the audience will have to be clear and focussed on the council’s net zero progress, rather than explainers on the concept of climate change.</p>
        <p>Language should be clear and affirm the existence of climate change, delivered with positive messaging, to improve engagement with and draw focus to community action plans and net zero targets.</p>
        <h2>Popularising Action</h2>
        <p>For significant behaviour changes to catch on quickly, the use of social norms and social influence can both accelerate the process and create more meaningful engagement. (Maibach et al. 2023, p. 69).</p>
        <p>Connect the message to existing strong community and cultural values through shared experiences and traditions (Nerlich et al. 2010, p.105). The effectiveness of climate communication depends on the ability of the audience to respond to the policies.</p>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The information and policies presented to the audience should target the chosen audience’s specific demographic. Additionally, the audience will respond to the message differently depending on who delivers the message. A peer member targeting the audience builds trust and belief in the extent that a community can make effective change.</p>

    <div class="section" id="Solution">
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>An interschool student-led program, in collaboration with local organisations and businesses, where students are given the opportunity to innovatively contribute to net zero targets and communicate impacts at the Sustainable Living Festival.</p>
        <p>The Sustainable Living Festival is a community event run by the Boroondara council, attracting around 2000 attendees. The festival is free and family-friendly, with workshops and activities aimed towards sustainable living practices.</p>
        <p>The program would get high-school aged school children involved with a “project” around a key initiative of the Boroondara Climate Action Plan. The program would be student-led, to get students critically thinking about net zero targets in their own community. The culmination of this program would have the student groups involved with the Sustainability Living Festival, creatively presenting their efforts to the community at their own stalls.</p>
        <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
        <p>High school students are a demographic going through education at a time where internet and generative AI access is at their fingertips, ready to provide answers, whether true or not. The aim of a student-led program is to get students critically thinking about climate information, and misinformation. The program would also have the students involved in a hands-on project in collaboration with local organisations and businesses, helping make meaningful real-world connections.</p>
        <p>By targeting a primary audience of high school students, target secondary audiences are reached, composed of parents, teachers, neighbours and friends. These secondary audiences are likely to get involved, especially with the community-centered nature of the program. The program ensures peer members of the community are the primary communicators, sharing their contributions to net zero targets, with a tangible impact on the local environment itself.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal of the program is to have the students involved in climate change impact projects, and communicating their endeavors at a fun community-centred event that has already been established and well received. The positive hyperlocal messaging and engagement would dramatically improve how climate communication is received, and the community-wide awareness on net zero targets.</p>

    <div class="section" id="Implementation-Plan">
        <h1>Implementation Plan</h1>
        <p>School groups would receive information on their projects and work over a school term on them, in collaboration with local organisations. The groups would get involved with the key initiatives in the Boroondara Climate Action Plan in a meaningful way. At the end of the project, the student group would get their own stall at the Sustainable Living Festival to actively communicate their involvement in achieving net zero targets and impacting climate change.</p>
        <p>For example, a group may receive a project on the climate action goals of recycling and adapting new technologies to achieve goals. An example partner they may reach out to could be Rethink Recycling Co-op, an organisation that “increases awareness and local community ownership of our plastic waste” - this group has been present at the Sustainable Living Festival in the past. Over the semester, the students would learn about local waste collection practices and how to improve recycling, and get involved in a program with Rethink Recycling Co-op to collect plastic waste and take it from rubbish to a new product. Using their gained experience, students would use their stall at the Sustainable Living Festival to run a workshop and share with the community concepts like turning everyday plastics into functional items and circular economy.</p>
